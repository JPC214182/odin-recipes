        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>A specific slice/chop of pork from the loin of a pig</p>
        <p>Pork chops are a popular and versatile cut of meat, prized for their mild flavor and lean texture. They can be prepared in countless ways, and the cooking method often depends on the thickness of the chop.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Porkchops</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Water</li>

                <li>Add water and sugar. Let boil. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes or until the pork becomes tender. Note: add more water if needed.</li>
                <li>Put-in the onions, salt (only if needed), and pepper. Cook for 8 more minute. Note: The dish should have some sauce in it when its done. Adding enough water in the middle of the process will help as long as you make sure that you control the amount.</li>
