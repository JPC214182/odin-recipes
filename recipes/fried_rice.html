                                <ul>
                                    <li>Make sure you are using cold, day-old cooked rice.</li>
                                    <li>Whisk the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                                    <li>Chop any fresh vegetables you're using, like onions or scallions.</li>
                                    <li>Chop any fresh vegetables you're using, like onions or scallions.</li>
                                </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook the Eggs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heat a little oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.</li>
                            <li>Pour in the whisked eggs and quickly scramble them. Once cooked, remove them from the pan and set them aside.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saut√© the Aromatics and Vegetables:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add a bit more oil to the hot pan.</li>
                            <li>Add your diced onions or garlic and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                            <li>Add any harder vegetables, like diced carrots, and cook for a minute or two. If using frozen peas and carrots, you can often add them a bit later.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the Rice:

                            <li>Add the cold rice to the pan. Use your spatula to break up any clumps.</li>
                            <li>Stir-fry the rice for several minutes, allowing it to heat through and slightly crisp up. The goal is to get each grain coated in the oil and separated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>Add the cooked scrambled eggs and any other vegetables (like peas or corn) back to the pan.</li>
                            <li>Pour in the soy sauce and continue to stir-fry everything together until the rice is evenly coated and has a consistent color.</li>
                            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. You can add a little more soy sauce or a dash of black pepper.</li>
                            <li>If using, stir in a touch of toasted sesame oil right before serving.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Garnish with the green parts of the scallions if you have them.</li>
                            <li>Serve the fried rice hot, either on its own or as a side dish.</li>
                        </ul>
