                <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Vegetable soup is a comforting and hearty dish consisting of a variety of vegetables.</p>
                    <p>The foundation of the soup is typically a vegetable or chicken broth. This liquid is what carries and amplifies the flavors of all the ingredients. Some recipes may call for a tomato-based broth, while others are clear.</p>
